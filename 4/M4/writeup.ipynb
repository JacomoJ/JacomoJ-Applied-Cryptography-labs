    "# Idea\n",
    "The idea is different from M3 because I need to know the content of the block before the byte that I need to guess, which is not possible since the bytes before the last byte is part of the flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, I guess from the first byte of the flag onward. To do so, I need to know exact size of the flag so I can determine how much to prepad such that the byte that I need to guess appears as the last byte of the \"guess_block\" that is a block with everything that we know except for the last byte. Then, I create 256 blocks that is equal to the guess_block execpt for the last byte and send them to the server so I can perform comparison to find the right byte."
